# 🔐 Decentralized Credential Verification System

A full-stack decentralized application that enables secure issuing, storing, and verification of academic & professional credentials using cryptographic hashing and IPFS.

## 🚀 Problem

Fake degrees and forged certificates are a massive problem in hiring.

- Recruiters struggle to verify authenticity  
- Institutions lack standardized verification systems  
- Manual verification is slow and unreliable  

---

## 💡 Solution

We built a **Decentralized Credential Verification System** that ensures:

✅ Tamper-proof certificates  
✅ Instant verification  
✅ No dependency on central authority  

---

## 🧠 How It Works

### 🔁 Flow: Issue → Store → Verify

1. **Issuer uploads certificate**
2. System generates SHA-256 hash
3. File stored on IPFS
4. Hash stored in database
5. Verifier re-uploads file → hash matched → result shown
